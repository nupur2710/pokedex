# Pokedex
● Design / Create a web application, using the PokeAPI, that consists of: 
    ○ A homepage - which would include: 
        ■ A search bar - that allows a user to search for a Pokemon. 
        ■ A random Pokemon card below the search bar which would change on a daily basis for every user but not on every refresh. 
    ○ A search results pages - with list of Pokemon that would match the user search. 
    ○ A details page - that would display all the attributes associated with the Pokemon.
